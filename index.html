        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a recent Computer Science graduate from North South University with a strong focus on 
            Artificial Intelligence. With 1.5 years of experience as a Teaching Assistant and hands-on 
            work across multiple research projects, I have built a solid foundation in machine learning, 
            deep learning, and computer vision. My interests include healthcare-focused AI, interpretable 
            and efficient vision models, and speech emotion recognition for low-resource settings. 
            I am motivated by research that addresses real human and clinical challenges and creates 
            meaningful impact. I am eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to work that advances 
            intelligent, reliable, and human-centered systems.

                Developing efficient and interpretable segmentation models using hybrid loss design, 
                architectural optimization, and explainability methods such as GradCAM++, with the goal 
                of improving reliability and clinical usability in fetal ultrasound imaging.

            <h3>AI for Synthetic EHR Generation (Duke University)</h3>
            <p>
                At Duke University's Kamaleswaran Lab, I contributed to building large-scale clinical data
                pipelines and structured temporal representations to support synthetic EHR generation. 
                My work involved engineering robust feature extraction workflows, supporting VAE–GAN based
                architectures, and assisting with fidelity and utility evaluations. A co-authored abstract
                based on this work has been accepted for presentation, reflecting our collaborative effort 
                to advance safe and reliable AI systems for clinical research.
